<p>This document is to illustrate the power of capturing name of movie and tv episode from random unstructured files develop by Quixom Technology and other tools</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-we-provide">What we provide</h2>
<p>We have developed a program which is able to detect number of valid file names and format(i.e. <code>mp4, m3u8</code>)<br>
The success ratio of our program is top of the all considering all the various name we found</p>

<ul>
<li>the biggest drawback of this package is that it is only designed to work on windows only hence it can not be deployed to existing data server</li>
<li>even for power of capturing media it requires custom filter (regex) to be enter to being able to capture tv or movie name from unstructured files and we already have a much better filter (regex) running currently on server which is able to capture names of tv and movie files</li>
<li>compare to this package we are able to handle many various cases of name</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Emby is a great package containing various feature like playing media, getting information etc.</li>
<li>Emby is required to host it’s own server to capture file and media</li>
<li>compare to many of it’s feature it’s file name capturing capability is very low in exceptional cases.</li>
<li>while our program able to capture information for about 22 content (including movie and tv) emby is able to capture only 2 contents from structure of 30 file cases</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comparison-with-filebot">Comparison with FileBot</h2>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>compare to other tool Filebot do provide some of it’s functionalities for command line argument</li>
<li>it has only few regex to match the file name which won’t give you better success ration for various other names</li>
<li>the built in regex provided by filebot is just able to capture some common name only and hence compare to our program it’s success ratio is not good enough</li>
